# SIC-Assembler
SIC-Assembler(Python) is the tool to convert SIC program(HL) to machine code which is understood by SIC.
Simplified Instructional Machine is a hypothetical machine used by many researchers to understand the basis of assemblers, linkers and loaders. This project is an implementation of SIC Assembler. What it basically does is take a SIC program and translates it into a object code which is intended for the the SIC to understand.
